Following the same concept as a project's README explaining how to work and interact with the codebase and associated tools, here is a README to explain how to best work and interact with me. This document will be evolving as I discover more efficient models of interaction or as I improve the phrasing.

If you don't understand or don't agree with something written here, please reach out to me, I'll be happy to discuss that with you!

# Who I am

I'm **French** and arrived in the US when I joined Akido.
It's ok to be too lazy and write Mickael without the ë, I won't be offended ;)

Since I'm French, I will likely have a hard time understanding you if you speak fast or if you use some words I haven't learned yet. I'll just ask you to repeat or to explain, no worries about that. I expect you to **ask me to clarify** if what I say doesn't make sense. Please do it. I know how easy it is to just pretend it made sense because you don't want things to be awkward. All I want is to improve my English and the quality of our communication link ;)

A few words about my past:

- I've been coding since I'm a kid (even before my family got internet access)
- I've worked as a software engineer and web developer, mostly in small to medium-sized startups
- I've worked as a security consultant / penetration tester - I was basically paid to attack and find out customers' vulnerabilities. Ask me about it, I've got a ton of stories to tell ;)
- I've also tried to start my own startup, GéoSchool. We were three engineers and I was the CEO, needless to say I learned a lot about the business side of things. Unfortunately, we failed to find a viable and scalable business model, and closed after 18 months.

# How to work with me

## If I am your manager / Team Lead

As your manager, I have two goals:

1. Make sure we deliver on our engineering goals by making sure you have everything needed to succeed
2. Make sure you are happy and you thrive in this team

The first part usually consists in making sure you know where to go, you know how to go there, and also consists in removing all the blockers from your way: giving you access to the right tools, the right people, and helping you resolve the difficult problems.

The second part is making sure that what we do makes sense to you, that you grow as an individual contributor, and that you are happy working here! This does *not* mean that I will be bringing you candies all day, but rather that I will enable **you** to solve your own issues.

## What I believe in

### Transparency

I believe you can't work, do a good job, and be happy about it if you don't know what is happening, why we are going this way, or why we took this decision or implemented that process that way.

In an ideal world, you can review who said what when and you can understand the context and the reason why any decision was made (some special things like firing employees are not included here).

Transparency is also a prerequisite to accountability.

### Open feedback and communication

I have had a few experiences where lack of open communication caused big issues. If I am your Team Lead, we have scheduled 1:1 meetings and I will periodically ask you what and how **I** can do better. I ask this because I believe everybody should always try to get better and improve how they do things. Being a Team Lead doesn't mean that I'm wise, that I know everything, or that I don't do mistakes. Every issue is an opportunity to improve and get better, and I find that exciting!

All of this is just impossible unless we can have an open, honest discussion about our actions. **I always assume the best intentions**, and you should too, so don't feel attacked if I "criticize your work" - all I'm doing is bringing you feedback so that we can find how you can improve. This requires trust - I recommend that you read the excellent *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team*.

Bringing constructive feedback to your peers is also super useful for them and will help them grow, helping you be surrounded by better people.

## Practical tips

- I love when people use threads on Slack, especially in large channels - it helps keep the discussion structured
- I might (rarely) Slack you or send emails to you during weekends or outside work hours. Unless my message begins with URGENT, I don't expect you to answer before the next business days morning. In case of emergencies, I will likely just call you on your phone.
- When I ask you to do something that **feels poorly defined** you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

## A note on interruptions

I'm always happy to help you or unblock you! Just send me a message on Slack - if I'm in the middle of something important I'll get back to you as soon as I'm available (generally under 5 minutes). 

Sometimes however I will be in a "deep focus" state, and I'd rather not be interrupted unless there is an emergency. Just send me a Slack as usual, and I'll get back to you.

If you are in the office and I have my headset on, it doesn't mean that I am in a deep focus state, but I still would prefer if you go through Slack first.
